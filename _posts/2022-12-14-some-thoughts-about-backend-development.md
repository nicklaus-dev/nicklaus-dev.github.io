## Trunk-based development

> Description: Each developer divides their own work into small batches and merges that work into trunk at least once (and potentially several times) a day.

### Practices

- Have three or fewer active branches in the application's repository.
- Merge branches to trunk at least once a day.
- Don't have code freezes and don't have integration phases.

### Ways to improve trunk-based development

- Develop in small batches.
- Perform synchronous code review.
- Have a fast build.
- Create a core group of advocates and mentors.
